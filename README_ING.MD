## Problem
Brazil, rich in biodiversity, faces serious environmental challenges such as deforestation, pollution, climate change, and poor waste management. These issues threaten not only the environment but also public safety. In this context, solutions like the Disaster Risk Management System are essential to monitor, predict, and prevent damage in high-risk areas.

## Project Objective
SafeZone is an intelligent system that uses IoT sensors to monitor and predict natural disasters such as floods and landslides. It sends real-time alerts to at-risk populations, offers maps and evacuation routes via a web platform, and supports authorities with strategic data and reports. Its focus is to save lives and reduce the impact of extreme events.
